// Modelled on chromium/src/ash/wm/toplevel_window_event_handler.* and the
// drag-lifecycle half of ash/wm/workspace/workspace_window_resizer.*
// (revision 7acd40ddefff49c9d36144999aafdbb674dbd07a).
//
// What is taken: the drag state machine and its completion statuses, revert on
// Escape, refusing a second drag while one is running, dragging a maximized or
// snapped window out of its state by the caption, and settling the drag into
// whatever edge it ended against, and a drag that follows one touch point
// instead of the pointer. What is dropped: pinch and two-finger gestures,
// flings, window cycling, capture through aura and everything that starts a
// drag from a hit-test on a frame - the decoration is what calls
// beginMove/beginResize, and the shell surface is what validates xdg serials
// first.
